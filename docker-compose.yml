    # Map port 5000 on your host machine to port 5000 inside the container.
    # This allows you to access the Flask app from your browser via http://localhost:5000.
    ports:

    # Mount the current directory on your host machine to /app inside the container.
    # This means any changes you make to your local files (e.g., app.py, index.html)
    # will be immediately reflected inside the container without needing to rebuild
    # the image, thanks to Flask's debug mode (auto-reloader).
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    # Set environment variables inside the container.
    # FLASK_ENV=development activates Flask's development features, including debug mode.
    environment:
      - FLASK_ENV=development
    # Optional: If you want to explicitly run a command on startup (overrides default).
    # command: flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000 --debug
